# NSYSU ADV_ML 2025 HW 
## HW1
* Analyze `datasets.make_circles` distribution by pytorch model.
## HW2
* Dataset: MNIST
* Target: Train an CNN model to predict the digit number in given dataset.
* Make model as small as possible. 
## HW3 
### 1. Develop RNN models to classify the images. (**Same as HW2**)
* Dataset: MNIST
* Target: Train the SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU model to predict the digit number in given dataset.
### 2. Deal with the text data, and learn how to embedd them.
* Dataset: HW3_ text.csv
#### 2.1. Develop two models to classify these texts into one of the three possible sentiments.
#### 2.2. Develop an RNN model that can predict the remaining words of a sentence based on the initial words you input.
