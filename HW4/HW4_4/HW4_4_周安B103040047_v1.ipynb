      "  \u001b[93mDocument: as children, we often have irrational fears of things we have not being given a proper introduction to - we are told numerous stories, some still ignoring the lingering question we harbor deep within - our monsters real? - or an allegory of our very existence? this idea is effectively used in recent films such as, 'the babadook', 'it follows', 'the witch' and 'under the shadow'. director bryan bertino ('the strangers') shares a similar notion of this with 'the monster'.kathy (zoe kazan) a divorced alcoholic and inexperienced mother is taking her young and mature of age daughter, lizzy (ella ballentine), to permanently relocate with lizzy's father. while driving at night through a remote, rain-lashed forest, kathy crashes into a wolf, which wrecks their car leaving them stranded for help - waiting for a tow truck and ambulance. from here on, questions are raised - where did the wolf come from? what was it running from? where'd it get those deep cuts on its body? or where did the body disappear too? strangely these questions are not justifiably asked by kathy, but by lizzy.the only voice of reason!ella ballentine is the standout here - reminiscent of a young reese witherspoon. inquisitive, timid, fearful and courageously carrying the weight of 'the monster', as she has spent much of her youth taking care of herself - and her mother - through flashbacks provided. one in particular truly showing her acting chops. zoe kazan also great as kathy tries to maintain her sobriety while navigating and understanding the needs of her daughter - yes an overused device in hollywood - but effective still none the less.scott speedman shows us halfway through the movie with little to say or do, perhaps a favor to bertino, whom he directed in 'the strangers'.cinematographer julie kirkwood offers very little to appreciate here - with bertino not fully utilizing her until the third act - with a beautiful shot of the enclosed woods. the monster itself plays a minor role - as the full look of it seems rather cheap.overall 'the monster' may not hold up well with most allegory horror films, but it will stand on its own merit for ella ballentine - as she comes face to face with the monster - or are understanding of what it means to let go and grow up - afterall monsters are only what we make of them.\u001b[0m\n",

      "  \u001b[93mDocument: in the words of john dillinger (johnny depp) spoken to his love interest billie frechette (marion cotillard, a good year), \"i like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. what else do you need to know?\" like a one legged pirate, \"public enemies\", helmed by hollywood's very own hd cam junkie michael mann (collateral, miami vice) limps along to the two hour and twenty minute mark and has, as ricky ricardo would say, \"a lot of s'plainin' to do\". in a world of well staged shootouts, fun and cocky dialogue and heartthrob's johnny depp (sweeney todd) and christian bale (american psycho), the words \"story development\" may or may not really make much of a difference, but let's not kid ourselves here, they really do. it is the 1930's and america has just declared their first war on crime, targeting some of the country's most notorious dangers to the well being of society. john dillinger is one such criminal, claiming bragging rights to the fact that he can clear out a safe in \"one minute and forty seconds flat.\" with the help of baby face nelson and pretty boy floyd there really isn't any bank they can't knock over or any jail cell secure enough to hold them in, that is until they are matched by the likes of fbi agent melvin purvis (christian bale). purvis pulls all the stops to remain hot on dillingers tail in attempts to capture him \"dead or dead\". along the way dillinger falls for billie, a coat check girl who you'd more than likely expect to catch wearing a three dollar dress in a room full of mink. their love is tested when dillinger is pursued and eventually restrained and locked away, only to escape once more through clever tom foolery in an attempt to fall back into billies arms once more while staying alive long enough to do it.to its credit, \"public enemies\" lives up to its expectations as a first rate gangster flick, steadily filling the screen with a barrage of machine gun bullets, almost to the point that you can smell the gunpowder from the fifth row. there's enough blood, gore and suspense to keep any action fan at bay, and if you don't squirm in your seat during end of the second to last scene you may need to check your pulse at the door. unless you've experienced a shootout in person, there is a particularly notable one between the fbi and dillinger in a motel at the pictures halfway point that should leave you breathless. in fact, if i were to rate public enemies on a scale for action alone, id happily award it with a five star honor, but this isn't meant to be just some run of the mile schwarzenegger popcorn flick, this is meant to be a fine slice of cinema, and cinema has certain prerequisites. as i stared up at a crisp digital print of the film, i couldn't help but wonder why a big budget movie of this caliber was decidedly shot, in michael mann fashion, in hd. at times, the image looked beautifully gritty and realistic, while at others as degrading and false as home video this makes me seriously contemplate why mann still insists on shooting on cheap digital cameras like the f-23 which he used for this particular project instead of actual film or even a red one. my question may never be answered, but ultimately it's the film's quality that suffers, which in turn managed to remove me on more than one occasion from the fantasy world of the picture. i wish i could say this was the only aspect that distracted me from my viewing experience.it seems as if in a stirring turn of events, which occurs somewhere between the main titles and the end credits, michael mann has failed to include even a stitch of character or story development. with the exception of her basic introduction at a dingy city bar, billie has absolutely no back story what-so-ever. this never allows us the opportunity to connect with her on even the most elementary of levels neither emotionally nor physically. the same goes for agent purvis, whose character is flatter than a dollar flapjack off the sunrise special, making this one of bale's most forgettable performances to date. there is absolutely no chemistry between depp and cotillard, which is a shame when you consider how dynamic both of these top notch actors are individually. to his credit, depp does manage to deliver another stunning, hardnosed performance as john dillinger and proves to once again be a complete joy to marvel at on screen. if only the story had as much pizazz. as a whole, we are presented with bits and pieces of celluloid that never quite seem to join together to make an actual movie, but rather come off as a series of disjointed, yet entertaining vignettes. you would think that by the third film in mann's powerful resume, he would have learned by now how to pace and execute a motion picture instead disproving his validity as a serious director by making these easy to avoid errors that stand out on screen like a bad spelling mistake. when you mix everything up in an over-sized pot and stir, the ultimate result is an undercooked, emotionless and disconnected final product. if you're expecting to walk into public enemies thinking it's going to be the next \"godfather\" or \"scarface\", you may find yourself severely disillusioned at the films conclusion. then again, if you walk into the movie expecting to be thrilled by impeccably staged action sequences and a few downright impressive shootouts you may find yourself satisfied with your ten dollar ticket purchase. either way, discerning audiences will demand explanation for why studio execs failed to well explain anything. someone tell mr. ricardo that it's time for his close up.\u001b[0m\n",

      "  \u001b[93mDocument: before i saw this movie i was having a faint idea about what to expect. i watched the movie with my fingers crossed after reading the reviews in news paper. especially after nishabd, aag and shiva i was expecting this movie to be another thrash by rgv. but at the end i like the overall movie and here i am giving 6 rating to it. what i like about the movie is it finds comedy in horror. i don't remember happening this before in bollywood movies. (chamtkar may be ..) with the humor in it the movie makes the audience tickle. better not to watch it by keeping any expectations in mind. it has very simple story line as of other rgv movies. a well settled married man (fardeen khan) accidentally kills his secretary come girlfriend (esha deol). the girlfriend then comes as a ghost to haunt her killer. and in all this the wife (isha kopikar) is confused because of her husband's weird behavior. the simple story line is no doubt has stretched by director and script writer. especially at the beginning, before esha dies and then she comes as a ghost, the movie goes with a low pace. but after that i think it gets the grip. the movie is rather funny because of some unique characters. specially the character played by zakir hussaina and inspector reddy. also the lady inspector character is unique and the way it has been used it is funny. othre than this, i also like the things fardeen tries to get rid of ghost, but fails. it is the overall presentation of scenes and their arrangements makes the entire movie fun riding horror experience. in all, it was a good try to give something new to bollywood audience, and i as one will accept it. may be some time later, we see more of such experiments done, and getting success at box office.\u001b[0m\n",

      "  \u001b[93mDocument: in this romantic action film, the daughter of an inspector general (played by athiya shetty) and the son of a notorious criminal (played by sooraj pancholi) fall in love. naturally, there is no easy path for such a romance.from the clips and descriptions, i expected a much more romantic and emotional film, and was disappointed with the actual plot. shetty and pancholi, both in debut roles, had good chemistry. pancholi was excellent, but i didn't feel that shetty gave a good performance. her unappealing character made a dramatic and unbelievable turn around from spoiled brat to sensitive adult, showing a weakness in story writing. the fight scenes were well-done, but the choreography and music were mediocre (with the exception of the fantastic \"main hoon hero tera\"). honestly, the best part of this average movie was during the credits, when salman khan sings \"main hoon hero tera\" in a charming video. the movie is worth watching for that alone, but don't expect a great deal from the film itself.\u001b[0m\n",

      "  \u001b[93mDocument: the initial premise is a good one - how a tragedy can make someone lose his/her faith and the principles on which he/she has based living. and then (about 10 minutes into the movie) it goes off the tracks and devolves into a bad after school special - a really, really bad one.lamb (a very bad character name) is supposed to have been protected from the evils of pop culture but when she travels through vegas she seems to know quite a few pop culture references. the bad girl activities which she undertakes are lame and tame. the \"jokes\" are even worse \"i'll have the peach shnap\" as she misreads the bottle behind the bar. ha ha.the backstory for 2 people who befriend her are glossed over - thereby wasting the talents of octavia spencer (and maybe russell brand if i am being generous in the definition of \"talent\"). oh yeah, lamb's parents (the extremely talented holly hunter and nick offerman) barely register any screen time or decent dialog and are additional examples of wasted opportunities.sure, lamb grows some through her experiences but it all comes too easily and too readily to her. and the audience can see the resolution way before it happens.such a disappointment from a talented writer and director, and a gifted cast so badly misused.\u001b[0m\n",
